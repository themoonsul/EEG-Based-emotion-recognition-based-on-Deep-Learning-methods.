Using EEG to identify emotions is a demanding and useful field of research in human-computer interaction. In emotional computing, a lot of effort has been done in recent years to identify and categorize emotions. This research study seeks to provide a thorough summary of the many approaches and procedures most recently updated in this area. By analyzing well-known publications, such as sentiment analysis using EEG signals, emotion detection using biopotential signals, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers, and emotion identification from multichannel EEG through deep forest, the results of various techniques are quantitatively mapped. It defines a comprehensive informing strategy combining numerous statistics from a range of structured data sources. In this thesis, we investigate a novel deep learning model architecture that uses a model structure to break down the original EEG data into a number of important signal components. The best model structure and hyperparameters have been sought after through several comparative tests. In addition, we used the open-source Python program MNE to enhance our comprehension, visualization, and analysis of human EEG data.
